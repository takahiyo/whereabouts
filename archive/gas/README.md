# Archived GAS Files

These files are legacy assets from the Google Apps Script (GAS) implementation.
They have been replaced by the Cloudflare Workers + Firestore architecture.

## Archived Files

- `GAS_コード.gs`: The original Google Apps Script code for the backend.
- `docs/GAS_新規デプロイ手順.md`: Deployment instructions for GAS.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`: Checklist for GAS deployment.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`: Status of the GAS implementation.
- `docs/NOTICE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Architecture diagram showing the GAS proxy setup.

## Reason for Archival

The system has migrated to a hybrid architecture using Firestore SDK (Plan A) and Cloudflare Workers (Plan B), eliminating the dependency on GAS proxies. These files are kept for reference only.
